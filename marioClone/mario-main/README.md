A game of Mario using JavaScript and Kaboom.js

View the tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/2nucjefSr6I)

In this video I show you how to build a Mario in JavaScript using the Kaboom.js library in my code editor of choice. If you want to see the full course on  @freeCodeCamp.org  , click here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OaHB0JbJDI

In the full course I use a preconfigured environment to code Mario. In this tutorial I create the game from scratch using my code editor of choice.
